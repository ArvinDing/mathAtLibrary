    <p>
		Liking math is unusual to some people who don&#39;t understand the beauty of math. I like to combat this mentality by helping kids learn more about math and enjoy math like I do.
		</p>
		<p>
		One of my favorite things to do is creating problems and puzzles for my peers to solve. I would like to continue to spread my influence on the community by reaching out to elementary school students to help them with a subject I am passionate about.
		</p>
		<p>
		My two years of teaching experience has taught me patience when talking with others and assessed me on how well I actually understand the most basic math principles. As Einstein said, <q><b>If you can&#39;t explain it simply, you don&#39;t understand it well enough</b></q>.
