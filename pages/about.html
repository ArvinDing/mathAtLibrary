		Liking math is unusual to some people who don&#39;t understand the beauty of math. I like to combat this mentality by helping kids learn more about math and enjoy math like I do.
		</p>
		<p>
		One of my favorite things to do is creating problems and puzzles for my peers to solve. I would like to continue to spread my influence on the community by reaching out to elementary school students to help them with a subject I am passionate about.
		</p>

		My two years of teaching experience has taught me patience when talking with others and assessed me on how well I actually understand the most basic math principles. As Einstein said, <q><b>If you can&#39;t explain it simply, you don&#39;t understand it well enough</b></q>.

       <p class="left">Hi I'm Arvin  </p>
	   <p> I enjoy making friends, playing games, and talking. I like to have fun regardless of where I am or how. When teaching kids math, I begin to realize how wierd math is. </p>
	   <p>In the end its all made up by all of us. As you go deeper and deeper, it seems less and less pratical. Even at early stages of math such as addition, some math questions simply 
	   don't make any sense. Some of my favorite examples are of negative numbers and how some equations like 2-4=? simply cant be represented as a story. It doesn't make any sense to have 2 apples and eat 4 of them </p>
	    Outside of debt or money, negative values have very little meaning. When teaching things such as addition or multiplication, its starts to become evident how much math is made up. It hard to answer 
	   many of questions for younger ones such as why we define 5+6 is 11. Many questions are hard or nearly impossible without memorizing it such as 8*8. 
	   Teaching is really fun in this aspect. In stead of seeing 2+2 as just 4 you begin to think about it like how many candies 2 freinds each with 2 candies have. You begin to think about how to explain the simpler overlooked things.
	   The moment they begin to understand, is ultmately the most fun moment in teaching. When you see everything come together, its such a magical expirence for them and yourself as the teacher.
		</p>
		<p> Arvin enjoys playing games,listening to music or learning.
