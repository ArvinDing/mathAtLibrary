      I wanted to take part in this club because I wanted the opportunity to make a positive change in other peoples' lives. Teaching math to younger students has taught me many skills, including
      dealing with people who have different personalities, skills, and backgrounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope to keep kids engaged and interested in math not only in school, but also outside of school and their future lives.

	I chose to volunteer at Math at the Library because it is a great organization that strives to make a difference. Volunteering at Math at the Library has helped me expand my skills in working and communicating with other people. I hope that I can contribute to my community and help others succeed in learning math. Math is an incredibly important skill in everyday life and I'm thrilled to be a part of this organization. I am looking forward to 2019!

		Liking math is unusual to some people who don&#39;t understand the beauty of math. I like to combat this mentality by helping kids learn more about math and enjoy math like I do.
		</p>
		<p>
		One of my favorite things to do is creating problems and puzzles for my peers to solve. I would like to continue to spread my influence on the community by reaching out to elementary school students to help them with a subject I am passionate about.
		</p>
		<p>
		My two years of teaching experience has taught me patience when talking with others and assessed me on how well I actually understand the most basic math principles. As Einstein said, <q><b>If you can&#39;t explain it simply, you don&#39;t understand it well enough</b></q>.
