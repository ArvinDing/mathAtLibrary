      We founded this organization with a simple goal to make a positive change in our community with our enthusiasm in math.
      Teaching math to younger students has taught me to be more caring and humble.
      I have also learned many skills in time management and communication with people who have different personalities, skills, and background.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope to help young kids engage and become interested in math not only in school, but also outside of school and their future lives.
      I am very excited for the opportunity to not only work with the enthusiastic volunteer friends but also these amazing kids that come to our math programs every week.

	I chose to volunteer at Math at the Library because it is a great organization that strives to make a difference. Volunteering at Math at the Library has helped me expand my skills in working and communicating with other people. I hope that I can contribute to my community and help others succeed in learning math. Math is an incredibly important skill in everyday life and I'm thrilled to be a part of this organization. I am looking forward to 2019!

	  With volunteering, Iâ€™m able to give back to the community in the simplest way possible. Helping others learn and understand math not only benefits the children I teach, but also my own ability to communicate and interact with others. I believe that to teach people is to reach them as well, and through math and education I can help others develop and grow. I hope to be a positive influence in the lives of those who attend Math at the Library just as I had mentors and role models in my past years. Iâ€™m very optimistic for this year and will work to bring out the potential of all the kids that participate in this program.

		Liking math is unusual to some people who don't understand the beauty of math. I like to combat this mentality by helping kids learn more about math and enjoy math like I do.
		</p>
		<p>
		One of my favorite things to do is creating problems and puzzles for my peers to solve. I would like to continue to spread my influence on the community by reaching out to elementary school students to help them with a subject I am passionate about.
		</p>
		<p>
		My two years of teaching experience has taught me patience when talking with others and assessed me on how well I actually understand the most basic math principles. As Einstein said, <q><b>If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough</b></q>.

	<p>Volunteering and teaching kids math has shown me that much of the school curriculum in mathematics does not cater to each student's individual needs. 
	Therefore, I believe that by teaching math to students and helping them individually, I am creating a positive impact in the community.
	This also rewards me with a sense of accomplishment as I feel like I am making a meaningful, albeit small, impact in the lives of the students. 
	Being a teacher has led me to realize that the learning experience is not just for the students, but for the teacher as well! 
	Therefore, I learned and gained the patience necessary to take the time to explain to children concepts that they do not understand well.
	I hope 2019 will be a wonderful year!

	I joined this program because I really enjoy teaching kids who need help. Seeing tutor kids finally understand a math problem they could not figure out is a great joy to see. 

	Personally as a person who use to struggle a lot with math, I understand how to help those who are struggling right now. As a contributor to the Irvine community, I believe that tutoring kids math is a very good way in doing so. I hope to teach kids and learn more about them through the year of 2019!

	   <p> I enjoy making friends, playing games, or just simply talking. I like to have fun regardless of where I am or how. </p>
	   <p> Doing math is a really fun hobby.  Every problem usually has 1 answer, but there are a limitless amount of ways to arrive at the answer.
	   It's really exicting when you finally solve a problem then to find another simpler solution over and over until the answer becomes intutive.
	   Even around me, people such as Kevin Du and Alex Yan have been integral in my math education. After learning so much from my community I want to give back and help continue the cycle of growth.
	   Helping others and the sensation of returning knowledge is one of the most rewarding feelings. 
	   <br>2019 looks fun!

	  I volunteer at Math at the Library due to my enormous passion for mathematics. Math is incredibly important in our lives, and we use mathematical concepts every day. Volunteering for Math at the Library provides me a great opportunity to make the community better by sharing my passion for math and providing others with opportunities to grow in this subject. I hope to leave others with a lifelong passion for mathematics and spread the belief that they can accomplish anything when they set their mind to it.

	  I made the decision to volunteer for Math at the Library because I've always wanted to help younger kids succeed in subjects they either struggle in or want to enhance even further. There are many things in math I have yet to learn, but I would like to take the knowledge that I already have and others. The main reason I chose to teach math is because math is incorporated into many aspects of people's lives and can help kids understand things that happen in modern society and in the community. I always feel good about myself when I help others and help younger kids think of math as a hobby instead of an obstacle.
	<br>
	<br>
This program will benefit both the younger kids that either struggle in math or want to learn more and will also benefit me in many ways. This program improves each individual's skills and abilities to comprehend math problems. Some things I want to benefit from this program are my leadership skills and my ability to work with smaller kids. I also want to improve my communication skills, especially with younger kids. In the end, I want kids to understand that math is a subject where trial-and-error is widely accepted and only helps to improve their math skills.
