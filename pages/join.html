Are you looking for a way to give back to the community? Are you looking for some leadership experience? Do you love working with kids? Do you love math? If so, sign up and come join us today! Our program focuses on fundamentals in math and you don&#39;t need to be a math genius. We provide training so you&#39;re confident in your teaching.
</p>
<p>
We are looking for passionate high school/middle school volunteers (age 13+) to spend two-hours a week including one-hour tutoring/teaching time at the library. You will be working with 2-3 kids every session and watch them learn and grow. If you can&#39;t make it every week, you can still sign up for whatever weeks work for you!
</p>
<p>
This is a great opportunity to help young students while also gaining valuable leadership skills. Two volunteering hours will be granted for each session for the time of preparation and teaching in and out of library. We are looking for volunteers who are willing to make a long-term commitment to the program.
</p>
<p>
We believe every kid should have a chance to succeed in Math! Join us to make this happen!
