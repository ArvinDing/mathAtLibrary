		<p> Hi I'm Arvin  </p>
	   <p> I enjoy having fun whenever and however. Math serves as a wonderful outlet to help express yourself and explain the world in a simpler light.</p>
		<p>Even so, when teaching kids math, I also begin to realize how wierd math is. </p>
	   <p>In the end its all made up by all of us. As you go deeper and deeper, it seems less and less pratical. Even at early stages of math such as addition, some math questions simply 
	   don't make any sense. 
	   <p>Some of my favorite examples are of negative numbers and how some equations like 2-4=? simply can't be represented as a story. It doesn't make any sense to have 2 apples and eat 4 of them 
	   . Outside of debt or money, negative values have very little meaning; consequently are hard for kids to grasp. When teaching things such as addition or multiplication, its starts to become evident how much math is made up. It hard to answer 
	   many of questions for younger ones such as why we define 5+6 is 11. Many questions are hard or nearly impossible without memorizing it such as 8*8. 
	   Teaching is really fun in this aspect. Instead of seeing 2+2 as just 4 you begin to think about it in terms of a story: How many candies 2 friends each with 2 candies have? You begin to think about how to explain the simpler overlooked things.
	   The moment they begin to understand, is ultmately the most fun moment in teaching. When you see everything come together, its such a magical expirence for them and yourself as the teacher.
	   </p>
		<p>In the end we do this to enrich math education and help younger growing children to build a love for math. </p>
