Founded in 2017 at Foothill Ranch Library, <b> Math at the Library </b> is a student-run nonprofit organization aimed to help K-8  students improve their academic achievement in math.  The tutors of our program are dedicated high school volunteers who are passionate about math and are willing to share our interests with young learners. Through weekly free math tutoring sessions at various local libraries and online, we help students with math homework or provide math enrichment materials for advanced learners. 
Now Math At Library has grown to encompass more than 100 volunteers and has held math clubs and tutoring sessions at six public libraries.  We also partner with <b> Code Champion </b> and <b> Girls Powering Girls </b>, two other student volunteer organizations to provide computer coding instruction and English language tutoring to our community.
