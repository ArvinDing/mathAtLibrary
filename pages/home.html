<h2 align="left">Who are we?</h2>


<p>Math at the Library is a math tutoring program founded in 2017 at the Foothill Ranch Library to help K-8th grade students improve their academic achievement in math.
  The program has expanded to the Katie Wheeler Library and University Park Library as we see the high demands in local communities.
</p>
<p>
In our experience working with elementary school students, we have recognized that many young kids enjoy and appreciate math in our program. We are happy to help.

<p>
Math skills taught in early childhood education are designed to provide a solid foundation children need to succeed throughout elementary school and beyond. It opens the door to Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) Careers in adulthood. However, small obstacles encountered in young learners could affect their self-confidence and attenuate their interests. Because of that, we sometimes hear elementary school students saying that they would never consider pursuing the math subject themselves because they are <q>just not a math person,</q> or they <q>never really liked math,</q> or <q>math is so boring.</q> The lack of enthusiasm for STEM fields in the earlier years of a child&#39;s education is very unfortunate.
</p>
<p>
The tutors of the Math at the Library program are a group of high school students who are passionate about math and are willing to share our interests with young learners and help them overcome the obstacles they face during their learning. We help students with math homework or provide additional challenging material for advanced learners. Part of math is learning how to solve problems using logic and reasoning; therefore, providing them with opportunities to practice their reasoning skills and strategies will help them develop invaluable life skills.
